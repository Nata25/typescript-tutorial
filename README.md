## TypeScript training scripts

These are tutorial excersices to get a better grasp of TypeScript modules basics.

Each folder contains a readme with some comments on what is implemented and how to use it.

Some demos were inspired by the _Microsoft_ online course [Introduction to TypeScript 2](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-typescript-2).
